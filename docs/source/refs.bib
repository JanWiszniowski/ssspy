	abstract = {Abstract We present a framework for stochastically modeling the Fourier spectrum of the noisy seismic recording based on the fundamental assumption that the latter constitutes a random rather than a deterministic quantity. First we demonstrate (mathematically and through simulations) that, under the stochastic-signal assumption, the periodogram ordinates of the noisy recording can be considered independent exponential random variables with a frequency-dependent mean. Using this finding, the estimation of seismological parameters is translated into a well-defined maximum likelihood (ML) problem, allowing a fast, accurate, and robust solution. Although the proposed ML methodology constitutes a general estimation framework that we believe can improve any spectral analysis, here we specifically apply it to the high-frequency attenuation parameter (κ), crucial for understanding rock ground motion. Other seismological parameters could be estimated by appropriately adapting the theoretical model and frequency band used. The greatest advantage of the proposed method is its ability to account for the presence of noise rather than simply try to avoid it, as is the case with all conventional κ approaches and many other spectral analysis approaches. This means that the proposed technique achieves acceptable results even for very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), thus pushing the boundary of what can be considered usable recording quality. The technique's superior performance in estimation is demonstrated through a series of experiments involving both synthetic and real seismic recordings. Our results also indicate that, compared to this new “noise-modeling” approach, conventional “noise-avoiding” approaches are likely to systematically underestimate the “true” kappa value in recordings of moderate-to-low SNR.},

The method is based on recalculation of the seismic moment into magnitude, whereas the seismic moment is obtained from spectral analysis. The method has been introduced at Polish seismic stations in the late 1990s but as of yet had not been described in full because magnitude discrepancies have been found between the results of the individual stations. The authors have performed statistics of these differences, provide their explanation and calculate station corrections for each station and each event source region. The limitations of the method are also discussed. The method is found to be a good and reliable method of local magnitude determination provided the limitations are observed and station correction applied.},

    abstract = {We present the software package hybridMT which allows performing seismic moment tensor inversion and refinement, optimized for earthquake data recorded by regional‐to‐local seismic networks as well as for acoustic emission activity. The provided software package is designed predominantly for use in MATLAB (see Data and Resources)/shell environments. The algorithm uses first P‐wave amplitudes to invert for unconstrained full, deviatoric, and double‐couple constrained moment tensors. Uncertainty assessment is performed by bootstrap resampling. The moment tensor inversion may be performed directly in the shell environment (by a dedicated command‐line tool) or conveniently through the MATLAB interface (m‐functions). In addition to moment tensor inversion, we also provide the MATLAB implementation of the hybrid moment tensor technique. This methodology increases the quality of calculated seismic moment tensors from events forming a spatial cluster by assessing and correcting for poorly known path and site effects. We tested hybridMT on synthetic datasets, acoustic emission data recorded during laboratory rock deformation experiments, and induced seismicity data from a geothermal reservoir. The package is supplemented with extensive documentation, tutorials, and a dedicated website. HybridMT is freely available and distributed under General Public License.},

    abstract = {The seismicity in the vicinity of the Song Tranh 2 reservoir that commenced in late 2010 is an example of reservoir‐induced seismicity. Moment tensor (MT) solutions are mostly normal‐faulting mechanisms with shearing as the main component of full MT, which suggest reservoir exploitation stress field changes as a triggering origin of this seismicity. However, the local tectonic stress field plays a role in the seismogenic process, which is accelerated by the reservoir exploitation. Two main orientations of discontinuities reactivated by reservoir exploitation are identified, with clustering of events located in two main areas: northern and southern. In addition to the northern cluster (NC) and southern cluster (SC), further smaller clusters are distinguishable, assuming both clustering of epicenters and similarity of focal mechanisms as the clustering criteria. Maximum seismic activities in clusters appear in different periods, with high seismicity in the SC preceding that in the NC. The results indicate significant differences between the NC and SC. It is shown that the SC is an example of rapid triggering, whereas the NC is a delayed triggering type. Also, magnitude distribution differs between the NC (b≈1.1) and SC (b≈1.3).},

    abstract = {Starting with a Green's function representation of the solution of the elastic field equations for the case of a prescribed displacement discontinuity on a fault surface, it is shown that a shear fault (relative displacement parallel to the fault plane) is rigorously equivalent to a distribution of double-couple point sources over the fault plane. In the case of a tensile fault (relative displacement normal to the fault plane) the equivalent point source distribution is composed of force dipoles normal to the fault plane with a superimposed purely compressional component. Assuming that the fault break propagates in one direction along the long axis of the fault plane and that the relative displacement at a given point has the form of a ramp time function of finite duration, T, the total radiated P and S wave energies and the total energy spectral densities are evaluated in closed form in terms of the fault plane dimensions, final fault displacement, the time constant T, and the fault propagation velocity. Using fault parameters derived principally from the work of Ben-Menahem and Toksöz on the Kamchatka earthquake of November 4, 1952, the calculated total energy appears to be somewhat low and the calculated energy spectrum appears to be deficient at short periods. It is suggested that these discrepancies are due to over-simplification of the assumed model, and that they may be corrected by (1) assuming a somewhat roughened ramp for the fault displacement time function to correspond to a stick-slip type of motion, and (2) assuming that the short period components of the fault displacement wave are coherent only over distances considerably smaller than the total fault length.},

The relative displacement on opposite sides of the fault is prescribed to be a step function of time. This configuration may be imaged in the earth's surface by symmetry, so that the problem is reducible to that of a propagating strike-slip fault of finite length in an infinite elastic medium. The observed events are the P and S waves from the two ends of the fault. Simplified “first motion” responses are computed and compared with solutions derived from the usual theory of force couples.},
